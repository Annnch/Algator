ChangeLog for project ALGator since November 2014

C7 (1/22/2015, td)

Analyser: added option to view query&graph in more than one tab
Analyser: new graph types were added (line, stair, bar, box)
Analyser: changes if the interface for defining X and y axis 

C6 (1/12/2015, td)

A Pass column added to an output array of Analyser.

A "Query" wrapper added to a query printed to stdout by Analyser.

A parameter with range @(from,to,step) added to the filter of a query.

 

C5 (12/20/2014)
A TimeLimit parameter was added to atts file. If the execution of an 
algorithm on a given testcase exceedes TimeLimit seconds, the execution
is killed. Default value for this parameter is 10 (sec).


C4 (11/28/2014)
Filter fixed to accepts output parameters. If an output parameter is a
part of a filter, filter keeps only those lines in which filter is true
for EVERY selected algorithm.

Property "subtype" added to parameter of type Double. Subtype is used to
define number of decimal places of a double.

Fix: the main form of Analyse changed from JDialog to JFrame.

A COUNT option was added to a query. 

A Testset column added to an output array of Analyser. 

C3 (11/24/2014)  td
Changed class si.fri.algotest.timer.Timer to enable several different 
timers to be used. Default usage (timer.start(), timer.stop()) wasn't 
changed. Simplest way to use several timers is by calling the method 
timer.next(), which stops the current timer and starts the next one.


C2 (11/21/2014)  td
Added -sourcepath option to javac. This enables source files in src 
folder to be in packages. Only the main class (algorithm class) must 
be in root (i.e. ALG-<name>/src) folder.

C1 (11/21/2014)  td
Two new atributes added to the project entity:
    ProjectJARs   ... the JAR files needed to compile the project
    AlgorithmJARs ... the JAR files provided by project administrator
                          that are alowed to be used in algorithms 
		
    Note: the filenames for these atributes are relative to the projects 
          lib folder (<project_root>/proj/lib)
