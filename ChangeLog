ChangeLog for project ALGator since November 2014


C1 (11/21/2014)  td
Two new atributes added to the project entity:
    ProjectJARs   ... the JAR files needed to compile the project
    AlgorithmJARs ... the JAR files provided by project administrator
                          that are alowed to be used in algorithms 
		
    Note: the filenames for these atributes are relative to the projects 
          lib folder (<project_root>/proj/lib)


C2 (11/21/2014)  td
Added -sourcepath option to javac. This enables source files in src 
folder to be in packages. Only the main class (algorithm class) must 
be in root (i.e. ALG-<name>/src) folder.
