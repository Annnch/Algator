export MYROOT = /home/my_data_root
  Defines an environment variable $MYROOT that points to my data root folder 


java algator.Analyse -d $MYROOT Sorting
  In this case the project Sorting is read from the folder 
  $MYROOT/projects/PROJ-Sorting, i.e., /home/my_data_root/projects/PROJ-Sorting


java algator.Analyse -q test1 Sorting
  Opens project Sorting, runs a query test1 and prints the result to the screen. 
  Query is read from $ALGATOR_DATA_ROOT/projects/PROJ-Sorting/queries/test1.atqd


java algator.Analyse -d $MYROOT -q q1 Sorting
  The project and the query are read from $MYROOT/projects/PROJ-Sorting/...


java algator.Analyse -o F -q $MYROOT/queries/q1.atqd Sorting
  The project is read from $ALGATOR_DATA_ROOT/..., the query is read from 
  $MYROOT/queries foled.

java algator.Analyse -o S Sorting
  In this case the query is read from standard input. You can copy-paste
  query (and finish with Ctrl-D) or you can pipe a query with '<', i.e.
 
    java algator.Analyse -o S Sorting < my_query.atqd
