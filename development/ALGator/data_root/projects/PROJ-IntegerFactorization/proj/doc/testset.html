To test integer factorization algorithms we use several test sets. Each test set contains up to 1000 numbers of different
size. Test sets have been splitted into three different groups: random numbers, product of two random primes and product
of two random primes that are not far appart from each other. These test sets are used to test the speed of the algorithm.

Usually we use integer factorization algorithms to factorize a number that is semi prime (product of two primes). That's
why we are using such test cases.
