<p><b>Fermat's factorization algorithm</b> works simillar to the trial division algorith, but in different direction; it starts with 1 and stops with a number smaller or equal to square root of number that we want to factorize. Fermat's algorithem starts with squre root of number <i>n</i>, therefore algorithm works fast for the numbers that are a product of two numbers close together.</p>
<p>Let $n = a \cdot b$ where $a$, $b$ are integers. We can also write $n$ as \( n = x^2 - y2 = (x - y)(x + y) \), where \( x = \frac{a + b}{2} \text{ and } y = \frac{a - b}{2} \). Fermat's algorithm now follows next steps:
<ol>
	<li>x = square root of n (rounded up)</li>
	<li>\( y = x^2 - n \)</li>
	<li>if $y$ is a square of some number, we are done</li>
	<li>if $y$ is note a square of some number, we increase $x$ by 1 and calculate $y$ as before</li>
</ol></p>
<p>Time complexity: \( O(n) \).</p>
