	<b>Fermat's factorization algorithm</b> works simillar to the trial division algorithm, but in different direction. We denote
	with \(n\) the number we wand to factorize. Trial division algorithm starts with 2 and stops with a number smaller or equal
	to \(\sqrt{n}\). On the other hand Fermat's algorithm starts with \(\sqrt{n}\), therefore algorithm works fast for the numbers
	that are a product of two numbers close together.</p>
<p>Let \(n = a \cdot b\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are integers. We can also write \(n\) as \( n = x^2 - y^2 = (x - y)(x + y) \),
	where \( x = \frac{a + b}{2} \text{ and } y = \frac{a - b}{2} \). Fermat's algorithm now follows next steps:
	<ol>
		<li>\(x = \sqrt{n}\) (rounded up)</li>
		<li>\(y = x^2 - n\)</li>
		<li>if \(y\) is a square of some number, we are done.</li>
		<li>if \(y\) is not a square of some number, we increase \(x\) by 1 and calculate \(y\) as before.</li>
	</ol>
</p>
<p>Time complexity: \( O(n) \).</p>
