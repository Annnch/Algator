<p>Let <i>n = p m</i> where <i>p</i> is prime number and <i>m</i> integer which does not need to be prime number. Our task is to find <i>p</i>. Now <b>Pollard's rho algorithm</b> uses the fact: if x1=x2 (mod p); x1, x2 from {0,...,n-1} then p|(x1 -x2). We know that p|n and  p| (x1-x2), therefore p | gcd(x1 - x2, n). !! We do not know the value of <i>p</i> but we could calculate gcd(xi - xj, n) for 1 <= i < j <= l and eventually find nontrivial divisonr of number n. Now we have to find xi and xj, such that xi=xj. We make two sequences; the first steps forward for step of length one, and the second for the step of length two.</p>
<p> s1 : x0, x1=f(x0), x2 = f(x1),...</p>
<p> s2 : y0, y1=f(f(y0)), y2 = f(f(y1)),...</p>
<p>We assume that at some point both sequences are in a cycle, from that point forward is just a metter of time until one sequence catches the onther. </p>
