<p>Let \(n = p\cdot m\) where \(p\) is a prime number and \(m\) an integer which does not need to be a prime number. Our task is to find \(p\). Now <b>Pollard's rho algorithm</b> uses the fact: if \(x_1 = x_2\; (\text{mod }p);\ x_1, x_2\) from \(\{0,...,n-1\}\), then \(p|(x_1 - x_2)\). We know that \(p|n\) and  \(p| (x_1 - x_2)\), therefore \(p | \text{gcd}(x_1 - x_2, n)\). We do not know the value of \(p\) but we could calculate \(\text{gcd}(x_i - x_j, n)\) for \(1 \leq i < j \leq l\) and eventually find nontrivial divisor of number n. Now we have to find \(x_i\) and \(x_j\), such that \(x_i = x_j\; (\text{mod }p)\). We make two sequences; the first steps forward for the step of length one, and the second for the step of length two. Mathematically we would write the sequences as:</p>
<p>\(s_1 : x_0, x_1=f(x_0), x_2 = f(x_1),...;\ f = \)</p>
<p>\(s_2 : y_0, y_1=f(f(y_0)), y_2 = f(f(y_1)),...;\ f = \)</p>
<p>We assume that at some point both sequences are in a cycle, from that point forward is just a metter of time until one sequence catches the other. </p>
