<p><b>Trial division</b> is the most basics integer factorization algorithm. In order to decompose an input number \(n\), the algorithm tries if numbers between 2 and \(n\) are divisors of \(n\). When algorithm finds such number, it divides <i>n</i> with that number and continues recursively.</p>

<p>In our implementation, the algorithm returns solution when it finds the first divisor. Returned result is an array with divisors <i>d</i> and <i>n/d</i>.</p>
