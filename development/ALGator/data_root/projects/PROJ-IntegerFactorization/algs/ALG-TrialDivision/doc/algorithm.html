<p><b>Trial division</b> is the most basics integer factorization algorithm. The algorithm tries if numbers between 1 and <i>n</i> are divisors of <i>n</i>. When algorithm finds such number, it divides <i>n</i> with that number and continues recursively.</p>

<p>In our implementation, the algorithm returns solution when it finds first divisor. Returned result is an array with divisor <i>d</i> and <i>n/d</i>.</p>
