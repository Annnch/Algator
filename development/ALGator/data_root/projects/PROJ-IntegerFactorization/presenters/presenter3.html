In this graph there are presented the results for the algorithms  
on the TestSet3.  It is showen that Trivial division is unefficient for large numbers. Efficiency of Fermat's factorization is ascending in the contrast to Brent's and Pollard's Rho factorization, which are decreasing with the size of number.
