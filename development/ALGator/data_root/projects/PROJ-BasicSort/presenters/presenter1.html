In this graph there are presented the results of all the algorithms  
on the TestSet2.  The results for the slowest algorithm (Bubble sort) 
are available only for \( n \le 20000 \) since after this value the 
algorithm was to slow (more than 1 second) and it was killed. The fast 
algorithms (JavaSort and QuickSort) behave very similar in this scale.
To see the difference between these two algorithms, see the graph below.
