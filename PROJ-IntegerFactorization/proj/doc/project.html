		An
		<b>integer factorization problem</b> is a problem of decomposing composite number into a product of smaller integers. Integer
		factorization is prime factorization if all factors in product are prime numbers.

	<p>There is no known efficient algorithem for integer factorization problem. But the difficulty of factorization of two numbers
		of same length can differ. For currently known techniques the hardest problem is decomposing so called semiprimes - numbers
		which are the product of two prime numbers. This is why a lot of algorithms in cryptography (e.g.
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)" title="RSA">RSA</a>) are based on the practical difficulty of the factorization of the product of two large prime numbers.
	</p>

	<p>We divide algorithms for factorization into two groups:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<b>Special-purpose algorithms:</b> Running time of these algorithms depends on the propertes of the number to be catored
			or on one of its unknown factors; size, special form,... Well known special-purpose algorithms are
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_division">Trial division</a> and
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollard%27s_rho_algorithm">Pollard's rho algorithm</a>.</li>
		<li>
			<b>General-purpose algorithms:</b> Running time of there algorithms depends just on the size of the input number.
